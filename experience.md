    <h1>Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Industrial Control Systems</h1>
    <p><strong>Funding:</strong> Qatar National Priorities Research Program (NPRP) from Qatar Foundation</p>
    <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Industrial Control Systems</p>

    <h2>Work Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design a novel framework for cyber-attack modelling and analysis for Cyber-Physical Hybrid Systems.</li>
        <li>Develop a virtual Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) SCADA control system testbed using Siemens Industrial Automation hardware and software for a Cyber-Physical Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant simulator.</li>
        <li>Propose and implement both online (PLC-based) and offline, central, and distributed attack detection, diagnosis, and mitigation techniques for the virtual HIL RO plant simulator.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
    <p><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python, Matlab, Simulink, IEC 61131-3 (LAD, FBD, SCL)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented prediction-correction filters for nonlinear systems, specifically Extended Kalman Filter and Unscented Kalman Filter, using SCL for Siemens PLCs.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented central SCADA Server-based attack detection techniques for ICS of Cyber-Physical Hybrid Systems using Python.</li>
        <li>Worked extensively with Siemens S7-1200 and S7-1500 PLCs, and ET 200SP Distributed I/Os (analog and digital modules), gaining proficiency in TIA Portal.</li>
        <li>Acquired knowledge of industrial communication standards, including Profinet and Profibus.</li>
    </ul>
